## War Losses Tracker

A small website for tracking and displaying losses in the Russo-Ukrainian War, made in Next.js

*Much of the credit goes to @scarnecchia for their oryx_data repository with data scraped from Oryx, and, of course, to Oryxspioenkop for their excellent work on documenting the losses*
