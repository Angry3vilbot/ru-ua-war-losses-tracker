## WIP

This README is a work in progress, so for now all I will say is that this is my first attempt at a Next.js app, so, hopefully, it all goes well

*Much of the credit goes to @scarnecchia for their oryx_data repository with data scraped from Oryx, and, of course, to Oryxspioenkop for their excellent work on documenting the losses*
